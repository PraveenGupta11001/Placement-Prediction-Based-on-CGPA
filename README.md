# Placement Prediction Based on CGPA
This project aims to predict the placement packages of students based on their CGPA using linear regression. The dataset used for this project, 'Placement', is in CSV format and contains two features: CGPA and Package.

## Project Overview

### Features:
- **CGPA**: Cumulative Grade Point Average of students.
- **Package**: The placement package offered to students.

### Goals:
1. **Data Analysis**: Explore the dataset to understand the relationship between CGPA and placement packages.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data to ensure it is suitable for model training.
3. **Model Selection**: Choose and implement the most appropriate machine learning algorithms for predicting placement packages based on CGPA.
4. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Train the models on the dataset and evaluate their performance to ensure accurate predictions.
5. **Prediction**: Use the trained model to predict placement packages for new data based on CGPA.

### Tools and Technologies:
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib/Seaborn (for data visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.10
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Usage
Follow the steps in the Jupyter Notebook `Placement_data_prediction_using_LR.ipynb` to:
1. Load and explore the dataset.
2. Preprocess the data (handling missing values, feature scaling, etc.).
3. Visualize the data to understand the relationships.
4. Train a linear regression model.
5. Evaluate the model's performance.
6. Use the trained model to make predictions.
